# This workflow is kicked off when a push, pull request even is received
# Or a tag is created.
#
# It can also be manually triggered by the user in which case, the result_name
# is added
# The testspace results have the following form:
#
#   A<workflow ID>:<author>-<branch or tag>
#   e.g. A25:lbrack-release-1.x
#   M<workflow ID>:<author>-<result_name>-<branch or tag>
#   e.g. M26:lbrack-hello world-release-1.x
