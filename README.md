# Git-flow Proof of Concept.

This is at the very beginning. We initialize a blank repos as follow:

* [New Repository](./chapters/new-repos.md)

  This chapter describes how to initialize a new repository. This should only be done 
  once when the repos is first created.

* [Getting Started](./chapters/getting-started.md)

  Basic explaning about GitFlow

* [Cloning Project](./chapters/cloning.md)

  This chapter explains how to clone an existing GitFlow repos and initialize it.

* [Feature (Simple Case)](./chapters/feature-simple.md)

  A simple feature branch demo. This is when, you, as an individual contributor
  decide to develop a feature.

* [Switching Feature Branches](./chapters/feature-switch.md)

  A simple feature branch demo. This is when, you, as an individual contributor
  decide to develop a feature.


* [Merging Feature](./chapters/feature-merge.md)

  How to merge a feature branch. This includes some "gotchas" about GitHub Pull Requests.

* [Feature (Collaboration)](./chapters/feature-collaboration.md)
  
  Collaborating on a feature branch. In this case, a user started to work on a feature 
  and want to share the branch with a colleague.
