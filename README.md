# Git-flow Proof of Concept.

This is at the very beginning. We initialize a blank repos as follow:

* [Getting Started](./chapters/getting-started.md)
  This chapter describes how to initialize the repository. This should only be done

* [Cloning Project]()
* [Feature (Simple Case)](./chapters/feature-simple.md)
* [Merging Feature](./chapters/feature-merge.md)
* [Feature (Collaboration)](./chapters/feature-collaboration.md)
